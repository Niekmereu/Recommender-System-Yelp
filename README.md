# Recomender-System
Recommender System

This code contains a recommendation system for the Yelp dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset. It uses matrix factorization and a simple gradient descent update rule. It uses cross-validation to verify the results. 

The data are extremely sparse, which means that many customers have only rated a few places. Many of the customers that are found in the test set, do not appear in the training data. To circumvent this, we alter our approach. We introduce a new variable (n_naive), which indicates how many times a customer must appear in the training data before we just plug in the grand mean as the prediction for this customer. In a similar way the grand mean is used for unseen customers (customers that appear in the test set, but not in the training set). 

# Parameters
- eeta: step size
- l: penalization factor to prevent overfitting
- n_naive: how many times must a customer must appear in the training set before we apply matrix factorization for this specfic customer.    It is generally a good idea to leave the customers that appear only once (n_naive = 2). 
- k: the dimensionality of matrix factorization
- iterations: how many times the training set is iterated over
